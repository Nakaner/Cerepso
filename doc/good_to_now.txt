## Updating

You can apply an update (in the correct order of course) twice but this will lead to some
inconsistencies you have to fix manually:

* If the update adds new geometries, these geometries might be duplicated if the previous
  application of that update succeded in writing them into the database. Delete all duplicated rows
  from all tables from the SQL console.
