 * Tables and Columns
 * ------------------
 * 
 * Cerepso uses a database schema which is inspired by osm2pgsql.
 * 
 * There are following tables:
 * * nodes
 * * untagged_nodes
 * * ways
 * * relations
 * 
 * All tables have at least following columns:
 * 
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 *         <th>name</th>
 *         <th>type</th>
 *         <th>description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_id</td>
 *         <td>bigint</td>
 *         <td>OSM object ID</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>tags</td>
 *         <td>hstore</td>
 *         <td>tags as hstore (execpt untagged_nodes table)</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_user</td>
 *         <td>text</td>
 *         <td>OSM username</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_uid</td>
 *         <td>bigint</td>
 *         <td>OSM user ID</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_version</td>
 *         <td>bigint</td>
 *         <td>OSM object version</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_lastmodified</td>
 *         <td>char(23)</td>
 *         <td>last_modified timestamp</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *         <td>osm_changeset</td>
 *         <td>bigint</td>
 *         <td>OSM changeset ID</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Of course, the database tables have geometry columns. Here they are:
 * * `geom` of type Point for the `nodes` and `untagged_nodes` table
 * * `geom` of type LineString for the `ways` table
 * * `geom_points` of type MultiPoint and `geom_lines` of type MultiLineString for the `relations` table
 *
 * ways table has additional columns about their members:
 * * `way_nodes` bigint[]
 * 
 * relations table has additional columns about their members:
 * * `member_ids` bigint[] – array containing IDs of all members
 * * `member_types` char[] – array containing either `n`, `w` or `r`
 * * `member_roles text[] – array containing the roles of the members
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Indexes
 * -------
 * 
 * By default following indexes are created:
 * * nodes_pkey btree (osm_id)
 * * nodes_index gist (geom)
 * * untagged_pkey btree (osm_id)
 * * ways_pkey btree (osm_id)
 * * ways_index gist (geom)
 * * relations_pkey btree (osm_id)
 * * relations_index gist (geom)
 * 
 * Using `-G`, you can add a GIST index on untagged_nodes table. Only use this option if you want to do special spatial analysis or queries on untagged nodes!
 * 
 * Using `-I` disables creation of indexes on `osm_id` columns. Use this if you do not want to update your database using diffs.
 * If you later want to update but have not used `-I`, don't worry! Just create these indexes manually.
 * 
 * 
 * Ordering
 * --------
 * By default, all tables are ordered by ST_GeoHash because most users do bbox like queries. This can be disabled by `-o`.
